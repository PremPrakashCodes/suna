# Fix: Shared Links Work Without Login

## Problem Statement
Shared links were requiring authentication to view, preventing users from accessing shared conversations without logging in.

## Root Cause
The Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase were incomplete:
- The `thread_select_policy` was already checking `thread.is_public` (fixed in a previous migration)
- However, `message_select_policy` and `agent_run_select_policy` were NOT checking `thread.is_public`
- This meant that even if a thread was marked as public, the messages and agent runs couldn't be accessed without authentication

## Solution
Created a new migration (`20251004080623_enable_public_thread_sharing.sql`) that updates the RLS policies to check the `thread.is_public` field:

### Changes Made
1. **message_select_policy**: Added `threads.is_public IS TRUE` check to allow unauthenticated access to messages from public threads
2. **agent_run_select_policy**: Added `threads.is_public IS TRUE` check to allow unauthenticated access to agent runs from public threads

### Why This Works
The middleware already allows `/share` routes as public routes (no authentication required). However, the database-level RLS policies were preventing access to the actual data. By updating the RLS policies to check the `thread.is_public` field, we enable:

1. **Unauthenticated users** can view threads, messages, and agent runs when `thread.is_public IS TRUE`
2. **Authenticated users** can still view their own content through existing permission checks
3. **Security maintained** through RLS policies that check both public flags and user permissions

## How Sharing Works Now

### User Creates Share Link
1. User opens Share Modal in the UI
2. System sets `thread.is_public = TRUE` (and optionally `project.is_public = TRUE`)
3. Share URL is generated: `https://yourdomain.com/share/{threadId}`

### Visitor Opens Share Link (Not Logged In)
1. User visits `/share/{threadId}` URL
2. Middleware allows access (public route)
3. Frontend fetches data using Supabase anon key
4. RLS policies check: `thread.is_public IS TRUE` âœ“
5. Messages and agent runs are accessible because their policies also check `thread.is_public`
6. User sees the conversation in read-only mode

## Testing
To test this fix:

1. Apply the migration to your Supabase database
2. Create a conversation in the app
3. Use the Share Modal to create a public share link
4. Open the share link in an incognito/private browser window (not logged in)
5. Verify you can view the entire conversation without authentication

## Files Changed
- `backend/supabase/migrations/20251004080623_enable_public_thread_sharing.sql` - Updated RLS policies
- `docs/SHARING.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the sharing feature

## Migration Safety
- Uses `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` to safely replace existing policies
- Wrapped in `BEGIN/COMMIT` transaction for atomicity
- Follows the same pattern as existing migrations in the codebase
- Only affects SELECT policies (read access), not INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding share expiration dates
- Consider adding password-protected shares
- Consider adding view analytics for shared links
- Consider social media preview cards (Open Graph metadata)
